## (Software Engineering.intruiging === Box.intruiging) &#8594; TRUE

  What would you say is the most intriguing object in the world? While the definition of my answer from Google is &#34;a container with a flat base and sides, typically square or rectangular and having a lid,&#34; my answer is the box. While some argue that it is too simple, but the reason it is intriguing stems from simplicity. The box has an abundant number of uses. While its primary use is to store things, it can also function as a stool. Also, it is the base concept of houses and portable technology. The box also has enormous potential for creativity. You can decorate a box until it looks like a rock, then change it to look like a statue. 
  This same logic also applies to software engineering. The field is so broad that one person can not be a complete master of software engineering. Its application is everywhere that a person would faint trying to keep track of all the software developed. While companies of any size build software, it is also possible for individual software engineers to make their own. The difference in creativity inputted into each software can range through an entire spectrum. It can start from a simple user interface then evolve to a complex and beautiful system. As a result, the broadness of application and creativity of software engineering is what captivates me.

## What do you need?

  As I progress through this journey, I hope to develop the proper mindset and communication skills. Both of these skills are the bare necessity for this field. To illustrate, The mental state will stabilize an individual’s necessary skills to effectively accomplish the task by improving critical thinking and finding different solutions. Then, the communication skills further stabilize the entire process as interactions are required. Effective communication is needed when clarifying project requirements with clients and managing the progress with coworkers. These skills will help to minimize delays and experiences of overly complicated conversations with clients and coworkers.
