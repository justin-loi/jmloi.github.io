## How is gene manipuation currently benefiting mankind&#63;

The major influence of gene manipulation is the benefits that some of the techniques may have. For example, corn is one of the most widely harvested genetically modified crops. By genetically modifying corn, scientists can create strains that contain more nutritional value. Also, compared to their ancestors, the size and number of kernels are exponentially bigger due to modifying in its genome. Not only that, since Lepidoptera larvae and caterpillars are prominent pests, scientists have genetically modified corn to kill them after ingesting a certain amount of protein. This is to lower the amount of pesticides needed to be sprayed. 

Another example of a widely used genetically modified crop is the banana. In the 1950s, the banana faced extinction due to the Panama disease, which is a fungal pathogen that originated in South America. The Panama disease spread through most of the world’s commercial farms, and the extinction of the world’s banana supply seemed imminent. However, scientists genetically modified a species of bananas, the Cavendish, making them immune to the diseases, thus, the bananas avoided extinction. While these outcomes seem to be beneficial, it only solved a symptom of the problem, but not the root cause.

## Anything good must have some flaws … Gene manipulation is no exception

Gene manipulation of our crops only solves health problems in the short-term because it promotes a lack of genetic diversity. By genetically modifying a crop, a lack of genetic diversity happens because scientists want to create offspring that are genetically similar to their parents, so they possess the same modified gene. As a result, if another disease threatens genetically modified crops, their extinction is guaranteed because we have been so reliant on one strain that we would have no other alternatives. For example, the banana population is facing extinction again because 99% of all the world’s commercial bananas are Cavendish bananas, which are now facing a new disease, similar to the Panama disease, the Foc TR4. Not only does genetic manipulation have a part in agriculture, but it also has a role in the animal kingdom.

Even without the advanced technology, there has been a slow genetic manipulation by breeding animals with certain characteristics to develop desired traits. This results with these animals having certain distinguishing features such as a higher jumping ability or keener eyes. This plays a role in the life cycle because it ensures that the animals with the best traits survive and pass it down to their offspring. This also leads to a vast amount of species becoming extinct because they were unable to evolve fast enough to survive.

However, with advanced technology in our grasp, we are able to bring back these extinct species. By removing an intact nuclei from an extinct species and removing the nucleus of the egg from their closest living relative, the possibility of bringing back extinct species is highly probable. For example, in 2003, scientists were able to accomplish this using the bucardo, also known as the Pyrenean ibex. After the extinction of its species due to overhunting, an intact nuclei was recovered from the corpse. It was then implanted into emptied goat eggs, resulting in the birth of an alive bucardo. Even though, it died ten minutes after it was born due to breathing issues. This accomplishment shows the possibility of bringing back extinct animals, but the question becomes, “Is it necessary?” 

While many believe that resurrecting extinct species would help correct some of the mistakes humans have made, it would not because of all the problems that will come with it. For instance, the vast amount of money and resources needed to repopulate the species is one of the many problems. Another issue is the effects these animals would bring into their new environments and the ecosystems are unpredictable. Finally, the exorbitant amount of money that we would be spending on their de-extinction, could be better used to sustain the endangered animals still alive and their habitats that are slowly becoming lost. 

Finally, the biggest concern of genetic manipulation is how it will affect the human species. The ability to edit genes for the human species is similar to opening Pandora’s Box, seemingly beneficial and tempting, but it  filled the world with problems that could not have been predicted. The tempting part of gene manipulation is the possibilities in the advancement of medicine. Instead of relying on methods that can have devastating side effects, like chemotherapy, why not edit the genes to stop the cancer from growing. Additionally why make an unborn child suffer with a disease when you can simply edit the gene out. Thus, the views of gene manipulation seem wonderful in that aspect. 

However, there are always consequences to these breakthroughs. The major one is that there is an ongoing moral debate. Since creating humans is said to be God’s work, people of the Catholic community believe gene manipulation is blasphemy because we are acting as God. Not only that, it would increase the disparity between the rich and the poor. This stems from the belief that if doctors manipulate genes to cure diseases, doctors would also have the ability to manipulate other traits. For example, in the future, a doctor would be able to offer services to make their child more muscular and have an abnormally large IQ. As a result, that would give them an unfair advantage in life. Thus the advances of genetic manipulation must wait until we can properly debate these ethical issues and reach a consensus. 


## Conclusion

While gene manipulation does have a number of benefits, it causes more negative outcomes. The only way to be 100% sure that gene manipulation does not go down the wrong path is by not using it in any form completely. However since there will be a great opposition, the government and scientists involved should take the first step to collaborate and make more specific laws to give gene manipulation the proper space to maximize the benefits and minimize the consequences.
