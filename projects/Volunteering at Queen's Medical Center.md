## Overview

The program "Baseball Derby" was developed by me and my brother in my high school class, AP Computer Science Principles, school year 2016-2017. Since this was the first year of Computer Science at Saint Francis School, it was apart of a group of "showcase" programs to peak the interest of the middle school division. It is a game that uses sprite sheets and moves images using a program built by the teacher. The objective of the game is to hit the targets as much as possible within three misses.  

## Role

As a volunteer of the Queen's Medical Center Radiology Department, my role was to ensure that patient records were properly sorted and updated. The supervisor on my first day explained my tasks, then I was left to my own work. My workspace was one of the many little cubicle in the section. As a result, this was a self-directed environment where you must keep yourself working. If you finished the work, it was your responsibility to find another tasks rather than receive work from the supervisor.  

## The Experience

Overall, this experience was the most valuable in terms of communication. Since I was left to be independent, I needed to figure out how to ask questions efficiently and effectively to avoid delaying my supervisor's work. In addition, since the documents I was working with were patient's records, I had to seperate my work from my personal life.
